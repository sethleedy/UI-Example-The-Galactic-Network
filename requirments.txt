	I expect your code to be neatly formatted and with no errors.You must use a doctype (as always) and make sure your code validates. (http://validator.w3.org)

All files must be uploaded to your server that you have used all semester. Create a link on your home page to the first page of your final - the anchor text should read: "Final Project". 

Also please upload ALL files to Angel as well. I realize this is time consuming, but if your server is down I will use that as a backup for grading. Please include the url of your site in the title field when you upload.
